python for WINDOWS 
1. we need python

3. and then you gotta need to install django
4. py -m pip install django
5. connect your git with vs code
6. if you can't connect, then install git extensions
7. cd desktop
8. git clone "URL", basically the git repository url (find green button that says "code" and coppy that URL) dont use ""
9. and then do "code film django"
10. once you have the repository, you run it by using py manage.py runserver

SOOO once evrything is done

you can click on the url

and goes on the search tab, add -> /admin/
username: aals
pass: 123

after adding an item on FILMS, you can check if the item is added or not by doing just that.

the files after the Django film:

The folder migrations, views, that's where we will do databases and queries in python
basically where we make functions for the database tables and queries

urls.py (under the film--pycache) is where we import functions, manage.py migrations

- python manage.py makemigration
- python manage.py migrate
- templates folder has html file
(to migrate the tables)
 
we could make a new branch for API still not sure, but uhh we could ask for more explanation later

right. that's all

PUSH -> git push
Pulling in changes -> git pull
git commit ->
git add ->
git fetch -> 
git status ->
